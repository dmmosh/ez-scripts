# EZ SCRIPTS #

Pressing the same buttons/commands is not fun. Which is why I have made this collection of smaller scripts, made to automate the most basic of everyday tasks. Over time, these small increases to productivity will amount to great time savings.

My customn scripts for automating annoying tasks, compiled and wrapped in wrapping paper for you to enjoy yourself.

I know it's not a lot right now.

generally the installation is:

'''git clone https://github.com/wettestsock/ez-scripts cd ./ez-scripts'''
